# Unity Lens Flare
## An implementation of Lens Flare in Unity
## Ben Sheldon

This repository includes a Unity Project, LensFlare, that demonstrates an implementation of how to use LensFlare in unity. Additionally, the exports folder contains a unity package import that you can use to direcly import a Directional Light with Lens Flare into your Unity Project (URP).

The following link provides a tutorial on how to implement lens flare as I did here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uena8GaOp_m2kc3PVUTQLIDRpW8IS2nzaqxEbsz9w-w/edit?usp=sharing
